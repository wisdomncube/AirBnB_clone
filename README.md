AirBnB clone is an emulation of the AirBnB web application.

I am required to do the following:
1. Create a data model and persist objects to a file (JSON file). The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between "My Object"and how they are stored and persisted.

2. Create an HTML code of my application.
